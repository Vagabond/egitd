egitd
  by Tom Preston-Werner <tom@github.com>

egitd is an Erlang git-daemon implementation that provides a more flexible,
scalable, and loggable way to serve public git repositories.

Development Status: Experimental

This software was in production use at github.com for a short time until it
became obvious that the communications model was flawed. To be specific,
if the upload-pack takes a long time to respond (for big repos), either the
timeouts have to be increased to unreasonable values (slowing the entire
transfer down), or some connections will timeout and fail.


INSTALL
-------

$ git clone git@github.com:mojombo/egitd.git
$ cd egitd
$ rake


RUN
---

$ bin/egitd -c <path to conf file> -l <path to log file>


CONF FILE
---------

The config file specifies the mapping between specified repo name and file location.

github.com        (.+)/(.+)       "/data/git/repositories/" ++ Match1 ++ "/" ++ Match2.
